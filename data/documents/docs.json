These degree programs are sufficiently flexible to adapt to individual plans of study and research.\nApply\nApplication deadline\nDecember 15, 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (This deadline is for applications for enrollment beginning in fall 2025)\nProgram length\nPh.D. 5 years, M.S.E. 2 years\nFee\n$75\nGRE\nGeneral Test - not accepted\nAdditional departmental requirements\nProgram Offerings\nPh.D.\nM.S.E.\nProgram description\nThe doctoral program in computer science combines coursework and participation in original research. Most students enter the program with an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, or a related discipline. Some entering students may have a master\u2019s degree, but that is not necessary for success in the program. Every admitted Ph.D. student is given financial support in the form of a first-year fellowship. In addition, all admitted Ph.D. students are automatically considered for the prestigious Wu and Upton Fellowships.\nCourses\nIn preparation for the general examination, the doctoral candidate, in consultation with a faculty adviser, develops an integrated program of study in one of the departmental areas of research. Such preparation usually requires two academic years for students entering with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and one year for students entering with a master\u2019s. Students are required to stand for the general examination at the end of the second year.\nA total of 6 courses are required. Three courses must be taken to satisfy the core breadth requirement, with one course from each of three main areas of computer science: Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Theory.  All students must fulfill the core breadth requirements plus one additional course by the end of the second year, demonstrating minimum competence in three main areas. The remaining three courses can be any 400- or 500-level course from any department in the University. Courses taken outside the Department of Computer Science require approval from the student\u2019s academic adviser and the Director of Graduate Studies.\nAll courses must be taken for a grade. A grade of B+ or higher is required to get credit towards course requirements, although at most one B will be accepted for a course that does not satisfy the core breadth requirements. Individual research areas may request additional courses in excess of departmental requirements or may require students in that subfield to complete specific required courses in fulfillment of course requirements.\nBreadth requirement core course list:\nArtificial Intelligence\n511 Theoretical Machine Learning\n513 Foundations of Probabilistic Modeling\n514 Fundamentals of Deep Learning\n524 Fundamentals of Machine Learning\n529 Advanced Computer Vision\n584 Advanced Natural Language Processing\nSystems\n475 Computer Architecture (See ELE 475)\n518 Advanced Computer Systems\n561 Advanced Computer Networks\n563 Wireless Networks\nTheory\n510 Program Languages\n516 Automated Reasoning About Software\n521 Advanced Algorithm Design\n522 Computational Complexity\n585 Information Theory and Applications\nGeneral exam\nThe general examination consists of a research seminar prepared under the supervision of a faculty member, followed by an in-depth oral examination on the contents of the seminar and the associated general area of research. The oral examination tests the student's knowledge in a number of topics relevant to the student's research area. These topics are specified beforehand by an examining committee in consultation with the student. The seminar is open to the public, and at least three computer science faculty members must attend. Two are invited by the student; the adviser chooses a  third faculty member who could be in any area of Computer Science or related fields.  The examining committee and the student agree upon a reading list for the exam. This document is to be made available to anyone present in the oral examination, and only questions pertaining to either the material described in the document or presented during the research seminar can be asked during the oral examination.\nOriginal research results do not have to be presented, but problems whose solution may lead to a thesis should be discussed. In many cases, the student\u2019s thesis is in the same area as the research seminar, but this is not required.\nQualifying for the M.A.\nThe Master of Arts (M.A.) degree is normally an incidental degree on the way to full Ph.D. candidacy once a student has successfully completed the general examination. The M.A. may also be awarded to students who, for various reasons, leave the Ph.D. program, provided the student has successfully completed the six required courses from the Breadth Requirement. Please note, students admitted to the Ph.D. program who do not wish to complete the program may be considered for an M.S.E. degree with approval from the department and the Graduate School. Ph.D. students who have already been awarded the incidental M.A. are not eligible to earn an M.S.E.\nFor students who entered the Ph.D. Program before Fall 2018: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing all the year 2 requirements -- 3 core courses, one additional course, and passing the general exam.  \nFor students who entered the Ph.D. Program Fall 2018 and after: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing the 6 required courses from the Breadth Requirements.\nTeaching\nTeaching experience is considered to be a significant part of graduate education. All Ph.D. candidates are therefore required to assist with course instruction for the equivalent of two terms.\nPost-Generals requirements\nPre-FPO\nThe preliminary FPO is a research talk given to the anticipated FPO committee approximately six months before the FPO date. The pre-FPO covers results to date and planned research, and serves as a preliminary critique of the proposed dissertation. \nGraduate students will present a public talk followed by a private meeting with the committee.  The outcome of the pre-FPO is not graded. Graduate students are provided with valuable feedback to the committee expects will guide any final work and will be incorporated into the dissertation.\nFPO Committee must be identical to the Pre-FPO committee; any subsequent changes to the committee require approval from the DGS.\nDissertation and FPO\nThe Ph.D. is awarded after the acceptance of the dissertation and completion of the final public oral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nChair\nSzymon M.

Over the last few years, we have found that for 99% of the responses to these inquiries can be found on this FAQ admission webpage. Most questions can be answered by simply reviewing or searching a topic, such as GRE, TOEFL, official transcripts, personal statement and document status.\nIn the rare instance when a question is not answered on one of the above webpages or in the general response below, a personalized email response may be provided. As noted in the above webpages, applicants are asked not to make email or phone inquiries about the receipt of documents.

CS MS applicants need to follow the Master of Science Deadlines.\nMS PROGRAMS\nThe Master of Science (MS) program is intended for those who wish to broaden and deepen their understanding of computer science. Columbia University and the New York City environment provide excellent career opportunities in multiple industries. The program provides a unique opportunity to develop leading-edge in-depth knowledge of specific computer science disciplines.\nMS applicants whose primary interests include software engineering, theory, AI, machine learning, vision/graphics, natural language processing, or other core CS areas should apply to the Computer Science MS Program.\nMS applicants whose primary interests include computer architecture, parallel systems, embedded systems, or digital/VLSI design should apply to the Computer Engineering MS Program.\n MS Application Priority Deadlines \nApplications will be accepted after priority deadlines; however, we encourage you to submit your application as early as possible after we open the application. \nFall: January 15th (Priority), February 15th (Regular)\nSpring: October 15\n   Track Options \nComputational Biology\nNatural Language Processing\nComputer Security\nSoftware Systems\nFoundations of Computer Science\nVision and Graphics\nMachine Learning\nPersonalized\nNetwork Systems\nMS Thesis\n  Still have questions? View our CS MS Application FAQs  \nDUAL MS IN JOURNALISM AND COMPUTER SCIENCE\nAdmitted students will enroll for a total of five semesters \u2014 approximately three in The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and two in the Journalism School. In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a seminar and workshop designed specifically for the dual degree program. The seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support news gathering. In the workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind.\n  Want to learn more? Visit the program website!  \nPHD PROGRAM\nA small number of highly qualified students are admitted each year to the PhD Program in Computer Science. Admission is very competitive, based primarily on research-oriented reference letters, academic grades, and overall experience and record. Applicants need not already hold a master\u2019s degree; bachelor\u2019s degree-level applicants are also encouraged to apply.\nMost admitted students receive full financial support through Graduate Research Assistantships, which consist of a monthly stipend plus full tuition exemption (continuation of support is, of course, contingent upon the student\u2019s satisfactory progress in the PhD Program and availability of funding). In addition, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science awards a small number of prestigious \u201cPresidential Distinguished Fellowships.\u201d These fellowships provide full financial support to their recipients. Applicants are strongly encouraged to seek external funding, such as government and industry fellowships. Also, Columbia rents low-cost subsidized apartments near campus for both single students and students with families.\nAll PhD students are expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activity full-time on-campus throughout the program, except possibly for summer internships elsewhere. Therefore, the department does not normally consider admission of part-time students.\nAlso, note that it is not possible to participate in the PhD Program through the Columbia Video Network.\n HOW AND WHEN TO APPLY TO THE PHD PROGRAM \nAll applications to our PhD Program must be made electronically. The online application system is available on the SEAS Admissions website. The deadlines for the submission of your fully completed application are:\nStarting the PhD Program in the Spring semester: apply by October 15 of the previous year\nStarting the PhD Program in the Fall semester: apply by December 15 of the previous year\nYou can still apply after these deadlines. However, be aware that applications are usually reviewed soon after the deadline, so late applications may not be processed as quickly or have the best chance of getting funding from our department.\n HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION \nThe SEAS Admissions website contains detailed information about all aspects of the application process.\nYou are also encouraged to investigate the research conducted in the Department of Computer Science prior to application. In particular, think about which faculty members share your research interests and also look at the research group homepages. Feel free to contact potential faculty advisors by email to request information about their recent research and publications and to ask about opportunities in their research groups or labs.\nFinally, become familiar with our PhD degree requirements.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a day in the life of our PhD students, check out the Demystifying the Dissertation: PhD Research Discussions seminar series, which highlights several Computer Science PhD students. In their videos, these students discuss their experiences and research projects.\n COMPUTER SCIENCE PhD PRE-SUBMISSION APPLICATION REVIEW (PAR) PROGRAM \nThe PhD PAR program offers a one-time review of an applicant\u2019s Personal Statement and CV. The review is done by a current computer science PhD student.

Admission to the program is highly selective with a limited number of openings and many strong applicants each year. Only applicants who possess a bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent are likely to be competitive for admission.\nOn-Campus Research Track Degree Options\nThe department offers two on-campus Master's degree options for students interested in pursuing a research career: the MSCS with thesis and the MSCS no thesis/no report. Both degrees require 30 hours of coursework. The no thesis/no report option is defined by more organized coursework than the thesis option, which requires 2 thesis classes. Students admitted to the Master's program do not need to declare which degree they intend to pursue. Students apply to receive the degree in the semester they complete the requirements for the option they chose.\nOnline Professional Degree Programs\nFor students seeking a professional master's degree, the department offers three master\u2019s degrees in an online format. Taught by UT faculty, many of whom are award-winning leaders in the CS research community, these programs provide a flexible learning environment while fostering personal engagement between professors and students. By the end of any of these programs, students will have gained the skills needed to accelerate their careers in their related field.\nStudents seeking a professional degree are strongly urged to apply to one of our online programs, which have a much higher capacity than on-campus programs.\nOnline Master\u2019s in Computer Science\nThe online Master of Science in Computer Science program is primarily designed for working professionals and those planning a career in industry who have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science or a related technical field and want to broaden and deepen their knowledge.\nLearn More\nOnline Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence\nThe Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) students will receive advanced training in natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, deep learning and related topics. The degree will provide a critical framework for understanding the ethical implications of AI technologies and equip students for an array of potential career opportunities \u2013 from engineering to research and development, and product management to consulting.\nLearn More\nOnline Master\u2019s in Data Science\nUT Computer Science has partnered with the Department of Statistics and Data Science to offer an online Master of Science in Computer Science program (MSDS). The MSDS program supplies rigorous instruction to expand your expertise in areas such as advanced systems design, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Interested in applying?\nLearn More\nPh.D. Students Pursuing a Master's\nPh.D. students may also pursue the research-track on-campus MSCS degree as long as it does not interfere with their pursuit of the doctorate.\nGraduate\nGraduate\nProspective Students\nMaster's Program\nCoursework Option\nThesis Option\nOnline Programs & Degrees\nPh.D. Program\nCourses\nFinancial Information\nIncoming Students\nCurrent Students\nPortfolio Program in Robotics\nCurricular Practical Training\nForms\nGraduate Student Talks\n2317 Speedway, Stop D9500\nAustin, TX 78712\nPhone: 512.471.7316\n \u00a9 The University of Texas at Austin 2024\nUndergraduate Office\nGraduate Office\nOffice of External Affairs\nWebmaster\nMission Statement\nContact\nUTCS Direct\nEmergency Information\nSite Policies\nWeb Accessibility Policy\nWeb Privacy Policy",

The total credit hours required for either option are 30. Up to 9 credits earned from another accredited institution may be transferred and must be applied during the first term of enrollment. For the thesis option, 6 credits of CIS 6971 are required and counted towards the 30-credit requirement. The student should choose one option when the supervisory committee is formed, and any subsequent change in option is subject to approval by the supervisory committee. The Graduate School requires that any change in option be completed at least one full semester prior to the intended date of graduation. (Note that once a student has taken the master\u2019s examination or has attempted a thesis defense, the option cannot be changed.)\nA student seeking a Master\u2019s degree in the College of Engineering may become a candidate for the Master of Engineering degree, provided the student has a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering from an ABET-accredited program or has taken sufficient engineering core coursework to meet the minimum requirements specified by ABET. Students who do not meet this requirement will be candidates for the Master of Science degree.\nMASTER\u2019S SUPERVISION\nEvery entering M.S. graduate student should attend the New Student Orientation, usually given right before or at the beginning of Fall and Spring semester. The Graduate Advisor provides general advisement for all new students upon entering the graduate program.\nIf the thesis option is chosen, the student must form a supervisory committee no later than the end of the second semester of enrollment. The committee chairman henceforth becomes the student\u2019s advisor. The student should consult the advisor for advice in creating and pursuing a plan of study. The supervisory committee must comprise of at least two members (including the committee chair).\nCOURSE AND GPA REQUIREMENTS\nAll Master\u2019s students must satisfy core and elective course requirements. The course requirement varies for each Master\u2019s degree program. Transferring any core course from outside of CISE to satisfy any course requirement must be approved by the Graduate Affairs Committee (see \u201cEstablishing Equivalencies for Core Courses\u201d below).\nAccording to Graduate School rules, students must maintain a 3.0 overall GPA, as well as a cumulative 3.0 GPA for all courses taken from CISE, to graduate.\nThe only passing grades for graduate students are A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, and S.\nThe Computer and Information and Engineering department does not allow graduate students to take undergraduate courses (3000-4999).\nCourses numbered 5000 and above are limited to graduate students, with the exception described under Undergraduate Registration in Graduate Courses. Courses numbered 7000 and above are normally for advanced graduate students.\nACADEMIC PROBATION\nStudents are expected to make satisfactory progress toward degree completion. Failure to maintain a 3.0 GPA will result in a student being placed on academic probation. Students on probation cannot hold assistantships or fellowships and must resolve their GPA deficit within two semesters. Failure to do so will result in dismissal from the degree program.\nConsult the UF CISE Policy on Unsatisfactory Progress or Unsatisfactory Scholarship for further details.\nCOURSE AND CREDIT REQUIREMENTS\nThrough the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering\nM.S. in Computer Engineering\n\nM.E. in Computer Engineering\n\n\nM.S. in Computer Science\n\n\nESTABLISHING EQUIVALENCIES FOR CORE COURSES\nIf you believe that you have taken a course, including undergraduate coursework that is equivalent to a graduate-level core course in our department, you will need to:\nObtain a copy of your complete final transcript from your prior institution.\nPrepare a copy of the course syllabus and catalog description of the equivalent course as well as any supporting material such as exams, projects, and homework.\nBring these items and a completed Equivalency Form to the instructor who teaches the core course for an equivalency decision.\nEmail the completed form to Adrienne L. Cook at alcook@ufl.edu.\nNote: The equivalency process differs from the process of either transferring your degree or transferring credits toward your degree. The transfer of credit process may be initiated with the graduate academic advisor after the third week of classes.\nTRANSFER OF CREDIT\nOnly graduate-level courses, earned with a grade of B or better (a B- does not count), may be transferred from an institution approved for this purpose by the Graduate School. Transfer of credit may be considered from course work taken while holding a classification level of 0 (non-degree seeking), 6 (postbaccalaureate), 7, 8, or 9 . Transfer course work must be taken within the 7 years immediately preceding the date the degree is to be awarded for non-doctoral degrees. Courses with \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d grading cannot be transferred. Masters See the \u201cTransfer of credit\u201d subheading under \u201cRequirements for Master\u2019s Degrees\u201d and then \u201cGeneral Regulations for Master\u2019s Degrees\u201d at https://gradcatalog.ufl.edu/graduate/degrees\nMASTER\u2019S EXAMINATION\nAll Master\u2019s students are required to pass an examination within six months prior to graduation. Students must be appropriately registered in their final term (three credit hours for Fall and Spring semesters and two credit hours for Summer semesters. Students with thesis option must register for three credits of CIS 6971 Master\u2019s Research in the final term. A graduation workshop is held every semester for graduating students to review graduation requirements.\nStudents with thesis option are examined primarily on their thesis topic. The scope of the thesis will be determined by the student\u2019s supervisory committee. Each student must request that the oral examination be scheduled, in concurrence with the Supervisory Committee Chair. The examination announcement must be posted by the Student Services Center a minimum two weeks prior to the examination. Committee members must be provided a copy of the thesis one week prior to the examination.\nNon-thesis option students are given a brief written examination after they have satisfied all course and grade requirements. The exam requires general computer science engineering knowledge and may be administered in conjunction with the Exit Interview. Questions regarding the exam and/or Exit Interview should be directed to a graduate advisor.\nAPPLYING TO ENTER THE PH.D. PROGRAM FOR CISE MASTER\u2019S STUDENTS\nCISE Master\u2019s students may apply to enter the Ph.D. program. A statement of purpose and three reference letters from CISE graduate faculty are required. The student\u2019s graduate record will be reviewed and evaluated by the admissions committee for entry into the Ph.D. program.\nAll Master\u2019s-to-Ph.D. decisions will be made in the early spring for the fall semester entry date. All materials should be submitted to the grad admissions officer at the Student Services Center before February 1.\nPROGRESS TOWARD THE MASTER\u2019S DEGREE\nAll requirements for the Master\u2019s degree shall be completed within seven years after enrollment. Full-time students are expected to finish their requirements within three years. If a student fails to do this, a decision will be made by the Graduate Affairs Committee as to whether the student should continue in the program. The decision is based on a recommendation by the student\u2019s advisor as well as on each student\u2019s progress towards the completion of the master\u2019s degree.\nMASTERS MINOR\nTo obtain a Master\u2019s minor, a non-CISE student earning a Master\u2019s in another department must complete one systems area graduate core course, one theory area graduate core course, and one elective graduate course, each with a grade of B or better. In addition, the Graduate Coordinator will serve as a minor representative on a Master\u2019s committee of the major department.
