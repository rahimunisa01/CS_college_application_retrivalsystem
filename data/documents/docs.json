Most students enter the program with an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, or a related discipline. Some entering students may have a master\u2019s degree, but that is not necessary for success in the program. Every admitted Ph.D. student is given financial support in the form of a first-year fellowship. In addition, all admitted Ph.D. students are automatically considered for the prestigious Wu and Upton Fellowships.\nCourses\nIn preparation for the general examination, the doctoral candidate, in consultation with a faculty adviser, develops an integrated program of study in one of the departmental areas of research. Such preparation usually requires two academic years for students entering with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and one year for students entering with a master\u2019s. Students are required to stand for the general examination at the end of the second year.\nA total of 6 courses are required. Three courses must be taken to satisfy the core breadth requirement, with one course from each of three main areas of computer science: Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Theory.  All students must fulfill the core breadth requirements plus one additional course by the end of the second year, demonstrating minimum competence in three main areas. The remaining three courses can be any 400- or 500-level course from any department in the University. Courses taken outside the Department of Computer Science require approval from the student\u2019s academic adviser and the Director of Graduate Studies.\nAll courses must be taken for a grade. A grade of B+ or higher is required to get credit towards course requirements, although at most one B will be accepted for a course that does not satisfy the core breadth requirements. Individual research areas may request additional courses in excess of departmental requirements or may require students in that subfield to complete specific required courses in fulfillment of course requirements.\nBreadth requirement core course list:\nArtificial Intelligence\n511 Theoretical Machine Learning\n513 Foundations of Probabilistic Modeling\n514 Fundamentals of Deep Learning\n524 Fundamentals of Machine Learning\n529 Advanced Computer Vision\n584 Advanced Natural Language Processing\nSystems\n475 Computer Architecture (See ELE 475)\n518 Advanced Computer Systems\n561 Advanced Computer Networks\n563 Wireless Networks\nTheory\n510 Program Languages\n516 Automated Reasoning About Software\n521 Advanced Algorithm Design\n522 Computational Complexity\n585 Information Theory and Applications\nGeneral exam\nThe general examination consists of a research seminar prepared under the supervision of a faculty member, followed by an in-depth oral examination on the contents of the seminar and the associated general area of research. The oral examination tests the student's knowledge in a number of topics relevant to the student's research area. These topics are specified beforehand by an examining committee in consultation with the student. The seminar is open to the public, and at least three computer science faculty members must attend. Two are invited by the student; the adviser chooses a  third faculty member who could be in any area of Computer Science or related fields.  The examining committee and the student agree upon a reading list for the exam. This document is to be made available to anyone present in the oral examination, and only questions pertaining to either the material described in the document or presented during the research seminar can be asked during the oral examination.\nOriginal research results do not have to be presented, but problems whose solution may lead to a thesis should be discussed. In many cases, the student\u2019s thesis is in the same area as the research seminar, but this is not required.\nQualifying for the M.A.\nThe Master of Arts (M.A.) degree is normally an incidental degree on the way to full Ph.D. candidacy once a student has successfully completed the general examination. The M.A. may also be awarded to students who, for various reasons, leave the Ph.D. program, provided the student has successfully completed the six required courses from the Breadth Requirement. Please note, students admitted to the Ph.D. program who do not wish to complete the program may be considered for an M.S.E. degree with approval from the department and the Graduate School. Ph.D. students who have already been awarded the incidental M.A. are not eligible to earn an M.S.E.\nFor students who entered the Ph.D. Program before Fall 2018: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing all the year 2 requirements -- 3 core courses, one additional course, and passing the general exam.  \nFor students who entered the Ph.D. Program Fall 2018 and after: The Master of Arts degree can be awarded after successfully completing the 6 required courses from the Breadth Requirements.\nTeaching\nTeaching experience is considered to be a significant part of graduate education. All Ph.D. candidates are therefore required to assist with course instruction for the equivalent of two terms.\nPost-Generals requirements\nPre-FPO\nThe preliminary FPO is a research talk given to the anticipated FPO committee approximately six months before the FPO date. The pre-FPO covers results to date and planned research, and serves as a preliminary critique of the proposed dissertation. \nGraduate students will present a public talk followed by a private meeting with the committee.  The outcome of the pre-FPO is not graded. Graduate students are provided with valuable feedback to the committee expects will guide any final work and will be incorporated into the dissertation.\nFPO Committee must be identical to the Pre-FPO committee; any subsequent changes to the committee require approval from the DGS.\nDissertation and FPO\nThe Ph.D. is awarded after the acceptance of the dissertation and completion of the final public oral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nChair\nSzymon M.

The Ph.D. program requires a minimum of three academic years of residence; required coursework is generally completed within the first two years. Students must maintain high academic standards during their graduate residence. A student's Ph.D. research must exhibit originality in the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem that is significant to the field of study. The option representative and executive officers are available to discuss concerns regarding academic progress.\nComputation is now pervasive, wide-reaching, and unavoidable in our daily lives, and in science and engineering. The Computer Science option gives students a strong grounding in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of computing, provides an introduction to cutting-edge research in a variety of subfields of Computer Science, and prepares them to apply computational thinking to a diversity of applications in Computer Science and beyond. Our students and faculty strive to:\nunderstand information and computation as intrinsic components of a broad array of natural and engineered systems\ntackle challenging and fundamental problems with the potential for long-term and real-world impact\ndevelop underlying theory\nnurture collaboration between traditionally separate disciplines\nThe graduate computer science option is primarily oriented toward Ph.D. research. Students complete advanced coursework to achieve a breadth of knowledge in the core areas of computer science, and specialized coursework in their intended research area as directed by their research advisor and the graduate option representative. The M.S. degree entails a thesis and coursework and is normally awarded in the first two years as part of the overall progress toward the Ph.D.\nThe department expects Ph.D. students to achieve:\na thorough understanding of the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of computer science,\ncutting-edge knowledge in the area of research specialization,\nthe ability to identify, formulate, and tackle problems at the research frontiers in the area of specialization,\nsuccess and originality in the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem that is significant to the area of research specialization,\nexperience in critically evaluating computer science research,\nexperience in effectively communicate their ideas in writing and in oral presentations.\nGraduate Program Details and Requirements\nRequirements for the Computer Science graduate program are listed in the current Caltech Catalog.\nFurther details and advice can be found here: Navigating the Ph.D. Options in CMS\nGraduate Options Administrator\nMaria Lopez\nmlopez@cms.caltech.edu\n(626) 395-3034\nGraduate Option Representative\nLeonard Schulman\nComputer Science Option Representative\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n1200 East California Boulevard\nPasadena, California 91125\nCommunity Portal\n|\nDigital Accessibility\n|\nPrivacy Notice\n|\nSite Content Copyright \u00a9 2025\n|\nLog In",

PhD applicants maybe required to submit TOEFL iBT or IELTS speak scores even if they meet the English proficiency requirements for admissions.\n1. Review these general University and School requirements:\nApplicants must have been awarded (or are about to be awarded) a 4-year bachelor\u2019s degree equivalent to that granted by the University of Illinois to be eligible for the graduate programs at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Applicants whose undergraduate degree is a three-year program may not be eligible for graduate-level admissions consideration at the University of Illinois. Eligibility depends on the country where the applicant received their degree -- please see the Graduate College's list of eligible degrees.\nThe University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign policy requires applicants to hold at least a 3.0/4.0 or higher GPA in the last two years of their undergraduate study to be eligible for graduate studies on this campus.\nApplicants who already hold a master\u2019s degree in computer science or computer engineering whose degree requirements are equivalent to a Siebel School for Computing and Data Science master\u2019s degree are not eligible to apply for our MS or Professional Master of Computer Science (MCS) degree.\nApplicants who do not hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science must have sufficient background in computer programming, data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, and theory of computation. We highly recommend applicants complete courses in these areas at a local university near them prior to submitting their application.\n2. Plan to meet the application deadline\nVisit our Application Deadlines page to review the deadlines for all of our Graduate Programs. All application materials, including the application fee, must be received by the posted deadline. (Posted deadlines are for U.S. Central Time Zone). Late applications will not be accepted. In addition, incomplete applications will be subject to denial.\nIt is highly recommended to have all application materials submitted one month prior to the deadline to expedite admission decisions.\n3. Complete the university's online application\nApply online.  If you are applying to the MCS in Chicago Program, please note that the program name in the application drop-down menu is: \u201cComputer Science (Site-Based Off Campus)-MCS\u201d.\n\nNote: Please do not send additional materials (e.g. publications, photographs, videos, CDs, or portfolios). These items are not reviewed during the admissions process.\n4. Pay the application fee\nThe university's application fee is $70 for US citizens and permanent residents and $90 for all other applicants. The fee must accompany the application by credit card payment with the web application. Application fees are non-refundable.\nApplication Fee Waivers: Applicants may qualify for an application fee waiver.  For details, see Application Fee Waivers.  Applicants with questions about an application fee waiver may contact the Siebel School for Computing and Data Science at grad-admissions@siebelschool.illinois.edu.\n5. Submit Unofficial Transcripts\nSiebel School for Computing and Data Science does not require submission of official transcripts during the initial application review process. Applicants must submit official credentials (transcripts, academic records, diplomas, certificates of degrees, etc.) only if they are recommended for admission to the Graduate College at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Applicants recommended for admission will be required to submit their official transcripts directly to the Graduate College.\nTo complete your application, please follow the instructions provided by the Graduate College:\n\u201cApplicants must list in the online application each institution of post-secondary education from which they have earned credit. Applicants must also upload scanned copies of their transcript / academic record (and diplomas or certificates of degrees if the degree is awarded and not listed on the transcript) for each of these institutions to their online application.\u201d\nNotes:\nScanned transcripts must include all grade records and the grading scale used by the institution. (If the grading scale is on the back of the transcript, a separate scanned page should be included.) If the original transcripts are not in English, native-language transcripts and an English translation must be uploaded. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that uploaded copies are legible and high-resolution.\nDo not upload password-protected transcripts. If you receive password-protected transcripts from your educational institutions, please print them and scan them to a PDF file before uploading.  Our Admissions Committee cannot view password-protected transcripts.\nSubmission of Official Academic Credentials (Graduate College policy)\n\u201cAll credentials uploaded to the online application are considered unofficial. You will only be asked to submit official credentials (transcripts, academic records, diplomas, certificates of degrees, etc.) if you are admitted. These must be submitted during your first term of enrollment at the University of Illinois.\nThe University of Illinois reserves the right to require official academic credentials at any time during the admissions process, and to rescind any offer of admission made if discrepancies between unofficial and official transcript(s) are found.\u201d\n6. Request Letters of Recommendation\nApplicants to the PhD and MS with thesis programs are required to have three letters of recommendation submitted. Applicants to the MCS program are not required to have letters of recommendation, but letters will be considered if included, especially if used to justify experience in lieu of required coursework, or other irregularities.\nIt is recommended that professional letters of recommendation be from academics. They can either be your faculty, advisors, or supervisors. If you have been away from academics for a significant amount of time, you may substitute non-academic references of your choice (e.g. immediate supervisors, etc.). Personal letters of references (e.g. from family members) are not recommended.\nThe letters should address your academic abilities and potential to succeed at graduate-level academic performance.

The challenge for the College every year is to select a class from a highly qualified pool. The College looks for compelling reasons to admit candidates, and the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores and GPA are all reviewed carefully. Having a strong undergraduate background in computer science, including C programming, is highly recommended for applicants. The Admissions Committee welcomes additional pertinent information that will aid in making objective and informed decisions.\nStudents are admitted to the master's program only once a year. The application deadline is Feb. 1 for admission to the following fall semester.\nApplication Requirements\nCompletion of the online application.\nReceipt of three recommendation letters (requested within the on-line application).\nScores from the general Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required. Applicant scores are expected to be at least 153 in the Verbal, 155 in the Quantitative, and 3.0 in the Analytical sections for the MS program.  This requirement cannot be waived.\nThe desirable minimum GPA is 3.0/4.0, though most candidates score higher.\nSee the Institute's English Proficiency Requirements.  Our department requires a 100 minimum score on the TOEFL. We will also accept IELTS to fulfill english proficiency.  A minimum overall score of 7.5 is required, with minimum section scores as follows:  Reading 6.5, Listening 6.5, Speaking 6.5, Writing 5.5.\nA student who is enrolled in another graduate program of the Institute may pursue an MSCS while that student is also pursuing his or her degree in the other major. To be granted permission to pursue the MSCS, a student must submit to the Office of Graduate Programs in the College of Computing the material required for admission to the MSCS program. This includes transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the GRE General Test. If the student is approved by the admissions committee to pursue the MSCS, the student will be notified in writing. At no time will a student outside the College be allowed to pursue a concurrent degree without prior permission of the admissions committee.\nAdmissions FAQ\nGeorgia Tech Coronavirus Resources\nAcademic Continuity Resources\nGuidance for Graduate Education\nHosting a Virtual Event\nMonitoring Coronavirus On Campus\nOneUSG Connect Training Online\nPartial Day Absence (How to Submit)\nWhich GT services require VPN?\nDean's Messages\nTuesday, August 3, 2021\nThursday, July 29, 2021\nTuesday, July 27, 2021\nTuesday, July 20, 2021\nTuesday, July 13, 2021\nArchive\nGT Computing Helping Stories\nComputing Framework Could Reveal Signs of Neuro Disorders Hidden within Brain Data\nFaculty Earn Fellowships for Heart Modeling and Data Optimization Research\nMeet CSE Profile: Grace Driskill\nComputing Student Runs into History Books for Athletic and Academic Achievement\nMachine Learning Encoder Improves Weather Forecasting and Tsunami Prediction\nGEORGIA TECH RESOURCES\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVISITOR RESOURCES\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.

In the workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind.\n  Want to learn more? Visit the program website!  \nPHD PROGRAM\nA small number of highly qualified students are admitted each year to the PhD Program in Computer Science. Admission is very competitive, based primarily on research-oriented reference letters, academic grades, and overall experience and record. Applicants need not already hold a master\u2019s degree; bachelor\u2019s degree-level applicants are also encouraged to apply.\nMost admitted students receive full financial support through Graduate Research Assistantships, which consist of a monthly stipend plus full tuition exemption (continuation of support is, of course, contingent upon the student\u2019s satisfactory progress in the PhD Program and availability of funding). In addition, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science awards a small number of prestigious \u201cPresidential Distinguished Fellowships.\u201d These fellowships provide full financial support to their recipients. Applicants are strongly encouraged to seek external funding, such as government and industry fellowships. Also, Columbia rents low-cost subsidized apartments near campus for both single students and students with families.\nAll PhD students are expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activity full-time on-campus throughout the program, except possibly for summer internships elsewhere. Therefore, the department does not normally consider admission of part-time students.\nAlso, note that it is not possible to participate in the PhD Program through the Columbia Video Network.\n HOW AND WHEN TO APPLY TO THE PHD PROGRAM \nAll applications to our PhD Program must be made electronically. The online application system is available on the SEAS Admissions website. The deadlines for the submission of your fully completed application are:\nStarting the PhD Program in the Spring semester: apply by October 15 of the previous year\nStarting the PhD Program in the Fall semester: apply by December 15 of the previous year\nYou can still apply after these deadlines. However, be aware that applications are usually reviewed soon after the deadline, so late applications may not be processed as quickly or have the best chance of getting funding from our department.\n HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION \nThe SEAS Admissions website contains detailed information about all aspects of the application process.\nYou are also encouraged to investigate the research conducted in the Department of Computer Science prior to application. In particular, think about which faculty members share your research interests and also look at the research group homepages. Feel free to contact potential faculty advisors by email to request information about their recent research and publications and to ask about opportunities in their research groups or labs.\nFinally, become familiar with our PhD degree requirements.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a day in the life of our PhD students, check out the Demystifying the Dissertation: PhD Research Discussions seminar series, which highlights several Computer Science PhD students.

Admission to the program is highly selective with a limited number of openings and many strong applicants each year. Only applicants who possess a bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent are likely to be competitive for admission.\nOn-Campus Research Track Degree Options\nThe department offers two on-campus Master's degree options for students interested in pursuing a research career: the MSCS with thesis and the MSCS no thesis/no report. Both degrees require 30 hours of coursework. The no thesis/no report option is defined by more organized coursework than the thesis option, which requires 2 thesis classes. Students admitted to the Master's program do not need to declare which degree they intend to pursue. Students apply to receive the degree in the semester they complete the requirements for the option they chose.\nOnline Professional Degree Programs\nFor students seeking a professional master's degree, the department offers three master\u2019s degrees in an online format. Taught by UT faculty, many of whom are award-winning leaders in the CS research community, these programs provide a flexible learning environment while fostering personal engagement between professors and students. By the end of any of these programs, students will have gained the skills needed to accelerate their careers in their related field.\nStudents seeking a professional degree are strongly urged to apply to one of our online programs, which have a much higher capacity than on-campus programs.\nOnline Master\u2019s in Computer Science\nThe online Master of Science in Computer Science program is primarily designed for working professionals and those planning a career in industry who have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science or a related technical field and want to broaden and deepen their knowledge.\nLearn More\nOnline Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence\nThe Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) students will receive advanced training in natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, deep learning and related topics.

The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with undergraduate degrees in other diverse fields leads to highly successful career paths. Our graduates and their careers today stand as strong proof to this philosophy. Within the realm of academia, pursuing further advanced study in computer science is also an option open to MCIT graduates.\nDue to the goals and nature of the MCIT program, it is strictly for applicants with limited or no past experience in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in Computer Science or closely related fields, should consider applying to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program instead.\n  To learn more about the application and admission requirements please visit:\nHow Do I Apply?\nVisit the Graduate Admissions website for additional FAQs.\nDegree Requirements\nOur Students\nOur students come from backgrounds as diverse as chemistry, history, medicine, law, mathematics, literature and fine arts. However, what they all share in common is immense drive and a strong desire to succeed in the field of computing and technology. With their unique combination of skills in Computer Science and non-Computer Science fields, they have gone on to succeed in both technical and interdisciplinary careers. Moreover, current students are very well connected with our tight-knit alumni community, and the MCIT network is growing with each graduating batch.\nWhat Should I Expect After Graduation?\nMCIT graduates emerge from the program as well-rounded and versatile individuals, and find themselves in a prime position in the job market. Past students have gone on to work in various roles at large companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook, as well as at entrepreneurial start-ups and smaller-sized companies across the nation. Moreover, with their diverse backgrounds, our students are also in a unique position to fill technical jobs in industries such as bioinformatics, medicine, finance, telecommunications, media and many others. A significant proportion of our students do internships in the summer between their first and second years of study, and these internships often lead to full-time employment offers. Our accessible and tight-knit alumni network, together with Penn\u2019s stellar Career Services and our supportive, reputed faculty, ensure that MCIT graduates are exposed to the many doors that are open to them after graduation.\nProgram FAQ\nWho should apply to the MCIT program?\nWhat if I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, etc.?

For questions related to the online application, don't forget to check the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) provided by the UCSB Graduate Division. The department receives thousands of applications every year and the review process starts very quickly after the application deadline. Therefore, all required application materials must be received by the admission deadline in order for the application to be considered complete for review.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nOnline Application\nApplications to the UCSB Computer Science MS and PhD programs are accepted once per year. All applications should be submitted through the Graduate Division\u2019s on-line application.\nIf you're from an underrepresented or marginalized background in CS, take advantage of our new PhD Application Support Program, designed to guide and refine your application materials with insights from trained mentors.\nMinimum Requirements for All Graduate Applications\nGrade-point Average\nA minimum of a 3.0 cumulative GPA in undergraduate study. During the review process, we re-calculate GPAs into context on a per-school basis for institutions that do not use a 4.0 GPA scale.\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nThe department does not currently require the GRE for any applicants. Because the GRE is not a requirement, we are prohibited from reviewing test scores for all applicants. Do not attempt to upload GRE scores to your application as they will not be reviewed. Further information is listed on the Graduate Division FAQ page.   \nNon-native English Speakers (or ESL Students)\nApplicants whose native language is not English are required to take the TOEFL or IELTS or Duolingo English Test (DET). The department requires a higher minimum score on certain tests than the University minimum score requirements; the department minimums are listed on the Graduate Division CS Department webpage. \nFurther information on the type of English language exams UCSB accepts is listed on the Graduate Division FAQ page and Graduate Division How to Apply page.\nExemptions from the English language exam requirement are permitted for applicants who have completed an undergraduate (bachelor's or equivalent) or graduate (master's, doctoral, or equivalent) degree at an institution where the verified sole official language of instruction is English. Further information on how exemptions are verified after the application deadline and during the review process is listed on the Graduate Division FAQ page.  \nAdditional Information Specific to PhD Admissions\nStudents may apply directly to the PhD program without a Master's degree. \nApplicants to the PhD program generally have a grade-point average of at least 3.5 in their undergraduate study.\nStudents entering this program should be committed to completing a PhD. The department discourages students petitioning to switch to the Master's program; such petitions are approved only under exceptional circumstances.\nCurrent UCSB Graduate Students\nTo switch to or add a Computer Science Masters of Science (MS) degree objective, please submit the Graduate Student Petition available on the Graduate Division website and supporting materials to the Computer Science Department Staff Advisor via email by the annual December 15 deadline. Do not complete the on-line application. Petitions & materials are reviewed along with the other graduate school applications received. Our department asks that you complete 3 of our CS graduate courses before applying to our MS program. CS graduate courses may only be added through approval codes by non-CS majors.\nTo switch to or add a Computer Science Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree objective, please complete the on-line application by the annual December 15 deadline. Do not complete the Graduate Division Graduate Student Petition. Only PhD applications and materials received via the on-line application portal will be reviewed. \nFinancial Support\nAll PhD applicants are considered for campus and departmental fellowships, including but not limited to, the Doctoral Scholar Fellowship, Chancellor's Fellowship, Regents Fellowship, and the Eugene Cota Robles Fellowship.\nAdmitted PhD students are typically offered financial support consisting of student employment, based on meeting all of the necessary eligibility criteria including academic good standing and department program requirements. PhD students may be funded by a combination of Fellowship awards, Graduate Student Researcher employment positions (GSRs), and/or Teaching Assistant employment positions (TAs).\nMS students may apply for TA positions each quarter and may be employed as GSRs upon availability with a faculty member.\n  Teaching Assistants (TAs)\nThe department accepts applications for Teaching Assistants (TAs) each quarter. The application website is available approximately 2 months prior to the start of a quarter. Priority for employment is given to first and second-year CS PhD students. TAs receive partial fee remission through their employment, along with a salary for their job duties. In addition, the department will pay Non-Resident Supplemental Tuition (NRST) for PhD students who are international students or domestic non-California resident students for the first year. Domestic PhD students MUST secure California residency prior to their second year. MS students who are TAs are responsible for paying their own NRST fees by the fee payment deadline. The department does not pay for the cost of housing or living expenses for any students.\nGraduate Student Researchers (GSRs)\nIt is anticipated that CS PhD students will transition to Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) positions during their second year. Students are hired by their research advisors to conduct research in the lab. GSRs receive either partial or full fee remission through their employment based on the percentage of their appointment. \nFellowships\nThere are several fellowships for which the department annually nominates students. These fellowships include the Microsoft Research Fellowship, the Google PhD Fellowship, the IBM PhD fellowship, and a number of centrally administered university fellowships. Students interested in being considered for these awards should talk to their research advisors about a nomination. The Graduate Division offers a number of fellowships for which students may apply after their first year at UCSB. These fellowships include research fellowship awards and a dissertation year fellowship. Information about funding opportunities can be found at the Graduate Division website. \nUCSB Computer Science\n2104 Harold Frank Hall\nSanta Barbara, California 93106-5110\nCONNECT\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nHELPFUL LINKS\nPay and Service Period Chart\nVisiting\nCareers\nPolicies & Disclosures\nINFORMATION FOR\nTechnical Support\nFacilities\nRoom Schedules & Reservations\nEmergency & Safety Information\nFamily Resources\nBudget, Travel, & Reimbursements\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Regents of the University of California.

The total credit hours required for either option are 30. Up to 9 credits earned from another accredited institution may be transferred and must be applied during the first term of enrollment. For the thesis option, 6 credits of CIS 6971 are required and counted towards the 30-credit requirement. The student should choose one option when the supervisory committee is formed, and any subsequent change in option is subject to approval by the supervisory committee. The Graduate School requires that any change in option be completed at least one full semester prior to the intended date of graduation. (Note that once a student has taken the master\u2019s examination or has attempted a thesis defense, the option cannot be changed.)\nA student seeking a Master\u2019s degree in the College of Engineering may become a candidate for the Master of Engineering degree, provided the student has a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering from an ABET-accredited program or has taken sufficient engineering core coursework to meet the minimum requirements specified by ABET. Students who do not meet this requirement will be candidates for the Master of Science degree.\nMASTER\u2019S SUPERVISION\nEvery entering M.S. graduate student should attend the New Student Orientation, usually given right before or at the beginning of Fall and Spring semester. The Graduate Advisor provides general advisement for all new students upon entering the graduate program.\nIf the thesis option is chosen, the student must form a supervisory committee no later than the end of the second semester of enrollment. The committee chairman henceforth becomes the student\u2019s advisor. The student should consult the advisor for advice in creating and pursuing a plan of study. The supervisory committee must comprise of at least two members (including the committee chair).\nCOURSE AND GPA REQUIREMENTS\nAll Master\u2019s students must satisfy core and elective course requirements. The course requirement varies for each Master\u2019s degree program. Transferring any core course from outside of CISE to satisfy any course requirement must be approved by the Graduate Affairs Committee (see \u201cEstablishing Equivalencies for Core Courses\u201d below).\nAccording to Graduate School rules, students must maintain a 3.0 overall GPA, as well as a cumulative 3.0 GPA for all courses taken from CISE, to graduate.\nThe only passing grades for graduate students are A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, and S.\nThe Computer and Information and Engineering department does not allow graduate students to take undergraduate courses (3000-4999).\nCourses numbered 5000 and above are limited to graduate students, with the exception described under Undergraduate Registration in Graduate Courses. Courses numbered 7000 and above are normally for advanced graduate students.\nACADEMIC PROBATION\nStudents are expected to make satisfactory progress toward degree completion. Failure to maintain a 3.0 GPA will result in a student being placed on academic probation. Students on probation cannot hold assistantships or fellowships and must resolve their GPA deficit within two semesters. Failure to do so will result in dismissal from the degree program.\nConsult the UF CISE Policy on Unsatisfactory Progress or Unsatisfactory Scholarship for further details.\nCOURSE AND CREDIT REQUIREMENTS\nThrough the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering\nM.S. in Computer Engineering\n\nM.E. in Computer Engineering\n\n\nM.S. in Computer Science\n\n\nESTABLISHING EQUIVALENCIES FOR CORE COURSES\nIf you believe that you have taken a course, including undergraduate coursework that is equivalent to a graduate-level core course in our department, you will need to:\nObtain a copy of your complete final transcript from your prior institution.\nPrepare a copy of the course syllabus and catalog description of the equivalent course as well as any supporting material such as exams, projects, and homework.\nBring these items and a completed Equivalency Form to the instructor who teaches the core course for an equivalency decision.\nEmail the completed form to Adrienne L. Cook at alcook@ufl.edu.\nNote: The equivalency process differs from the process of either transferring your degree or transferring credits toward your degree. The transfer of credit process may be initiated with the graduate academic advisor after the third week of classes.\nTRANSFER OF CREDIT\nOnly graduate-level courses, earned with a grade of B or better (a B- does not count), may be transferred from an institution approved for this purpose by the Graduate School. Transfer of credit may be considered from course work taken while holding a classification level of 0 (non-degree seeking), 6 (postbaccalaureate), 7, 8, or 9 . Transfer course work must be taken within the 7 years immediately preceding the date the degree is to be awarded for non-doctoral degrees. Courses with \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d grading cannot be transferred. Masters See the \u201cTransfer of credit\u201d subheading under \u201cRequirements for Master\u2019s Degrees\u201d and then \u201cGeneral Regulations for Master\u2019s Degrees\u201d at https://gradcatalog.ufl.edu/graduate/degrees\nMASTER\u2019S EXAMINATION\nAll Master\u2019s students are required to pass an examination within six months prior to graduation. Students must be appropriately registered in their final term (three credit hours for Fall and Spring semesters and two credit hours for Summer semesters. Students with thesis option must register for three credits of CIS 6971 Master\u2019s Research in the final term. A graduation workshop is held every semester for graduating students to review graduation requirements.\nStudents with thesis option are examined primarily on their thesis topic. The scope of the thesis will be determined by the student\u2019s supervisory committee. Each student must request that the oral examination be scheduled, in concurrence with the Supervisory Committee Chair. The examination announcement must be posted by the Student Services Center a minimum two weeks prior to the examination. Committee members must be provided a copy of the thesis one week prior to the examination.\nNon-thesis option students are given a brief written examination after they have satisfied all course and grade requirements. The exam requires general computer science engineering knowledge and may be administered in conjunction with the Exit Interview. Questions regarding the exam and/or Exit Interview should be directed to a graduate advisor.\nAPPLYING TO ENTER THE PH.D. PROGRAM FOR CISE MASTER\u2019S STUDENTS\nCISE Master\u2019s students may apply to enter the Ph.D. program. A statement of purpose and three reference letters from CISE graduate faculty are required. The student\u2019s graduate record will be reviewed and evaluated by the admissions committee for entry into the Ph.D. program.\nAll Master\u2019s-to-Ph.D. decisions will be made in the early spring for the fall semester entry date. All materials should be submitted to the grad admissions officer at the Student Services Center before February 1.\nPROGRESS TOWARD THE MASTER\u2019S DEGREE\nAll requirements for the Master\u2019s degree shall be completed within seven years after enrollment. Full-time students are expected to finish their requirements within three years. If a student fails to do this, a decision will be made by the Graduate Affairs Committee as to whether the student should continue in the program.
